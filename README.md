    <b> Tasks&Habits</b> 
</h1>

A Task Management and Habit-building App, representating my journey in Android as well as my first Kotlin App. 

<!-- #### Made with ❤️ <i style="font-size: 12px;">and</i>  -->



A simple efficient solution for users to create, edit, delete **tasks** and **habits** and assign them colored task tags and and distinguisable habit images. The app is available in both light and  dark mode.
